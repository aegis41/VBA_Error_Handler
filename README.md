# VBA_Error_Handler
Javascript code to generate error handlers for VBA projects

It's common when using VBA to have lots of procedures tied to events. By entering the name of the event handler sub that the VBA Editor automatically creates, you can generate the standard error handling to copy **over** the generated sub declaration or to start a new function.

##Steps
1. Paste the procedure name in the input box
2. Select the scope of the procedure
  * Private
  * Public
3. Select the type of procedure
  * Function
  * Sub
4. Click the "Submit" button
5. Click into the text box which auto-selects all the contents.
6. Copy (CTRL+C for PC, CMD+C for Mac) the text
7. Paste (CTRL+P for PC, CTRL+P for Mac) into your project
8. Rinse and Repeat as needed
